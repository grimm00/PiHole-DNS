## 🎯 Overview

The planning directory organizes all project planning activities using a hub-and-spoke documentation pattern. Each planning area has its own directory with focused documentation.

### Planning Philosophy

1. **Feature-Based Planning** - Organize work around user-facing features
2. **Hub-and-Spoke Documentation** - Clear entry points with detailed spoke documents
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Overview → Plan → Task Groups → Analysis
4. **Status Tracking** - Consistent indicators and progress monitoring
5. **Decision Documentation** - Rationale and context preservation

## 🎨 Planning Patterns

### Feature Development Lifecycle

1. **Discovery** - Identify feature opportunity
2. **Planning** - Create `implementation-plan.md` with task groups
3. **Implementation** - Execute tasks with status tracking (`/task`)
4. **Completion** - Document results and lessons learned

### Release Management

1. **Planning** - Create release directory with checklist
2. **Preparation** - Complete checklist items
3. **Release** - Deploy and document
4. **Post-Release** - Update history and roadmap

### Task Group Tracking

1. **Definition** - Clear task boundaries and deliverables
2. **Execution** - Status tracking and progress updates
3. **Completion** - Results documentation and handoff
4. **Review** - Lessons learned and process improvement

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Starting a New Feature

1. Create feature directory: `features/[feature-name]/`
2. Run `/transition-plan` to generate scaffolding, or create manually:
   - `implementation-plan.md` — Task index with YAML frontmatter
   - `status-and-next-steps.md` — Progress tracking
   - `tasks/` directory with group files (e.g., `01-foundation.md`)
3. Create README.md hub with quick links
4. Expand task groups: `/transition-plan [feature] --expand --group N`
5. Implement tasks: `/task next`

### Planning a Release

1. Create release directory: `releases/vX.Y.Z/`
2. Add checklist.md with release steps
3. Write release-notes.md
4. Update history.md and roadmap.md

### Documenting Decisions

1. Create note in `notes/` directory
2. Document options and rationale
3. Link to related planning documents
4. Update status as decisions are made
